# Disease-Identifier-in-Rice-and-Mango-Crops

This is a machine learning project which where I implemented a model which can identify the disease in rice and mango crops based on the images of infected leaves.

Following are the phases of implementation:
1. Data Collection
2. Image Segmentation
3. Feature Extraction
4. Multi Class SVM classifier
5. Calculating performance based on predicted values.

Working of the system:
1. Takes an input image of infected leaf.
2. Identifies the disease with some accuracy.
3. Suggests the predicted disease.
